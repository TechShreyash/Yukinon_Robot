## What is Yukinon for ?

Have you ever received Telegram in your group **spam, adder, flood,** people who send link, channel message, promoting, arabic ? Rose Bot is the automatic moderator that manages your Telegram group and punishes malicious users automatically for you.

## How does She work?

Just add Rose Bot to your group as an administrator and configure it with the command /help. It will be ready to protect the your group from spam, flood and attacks. You can set banned words so that the ban or mute of a user in the group when sent.
There is an anti-porn filter to be enabled to automatically delete and punish those who send pornographic content in your group.
You can adjust all kinds of punishments including message deletion, user ban, user mute etc. There is a captcha check to prevent the entry of VoIP users who automatically spam your group. You can set <b> filters|note|rules|welcome </b> message also for your group.

## Main Yukinon Features
### PROTECTION 
  * **Captcha** - Ask users who join the group to resolve a captcha, to filter out unwanted automatic logins.
  * **Anti-Channel** - Automatically delete channel messages if you enable it `/lock anonchannel` .
  * **Anti-flood** - Block those who send a lot of messages in too little time trying to damage the group.
  * **Blacklist words** - Create a list of words to ban: anyone who uses them will be punished.
  * **Anti-service** - I Can Remove Service Message In Groups Like Users Join Messages, Leave Messages, Pinned Allert Messages, Voice Chat Invite Members Allerts etc..
  * **Anti-language** - Delete messages containing characters from one of the following automatically
       * Arabic Language
       * Chinese Language
       * Japanese Language (Includes Hiragana, Kanji and Katakana)
       * Sinhala Language
       * Tamil Language
       * Cyrillic Language

### MANAGEMENT  
   * **Welcome message** - Set a message to be sent every time a user joins your Telegram group.
   * **Group regulation** - The /rules command allows users to easily consult the rules of your group.
   * **Group Filters** - Filters are case insensitive; every time someone says your trigger words, Rose will reply something else! can be used to create your own commands, if desired.
   * **Group Notes** - Notes are great to save random tidbits of information; a phone number, a nice gif, a funny picture - anything!
   * **Connection Mode** - This allows you to connect to a chat's database, and add things to it without the chat knowing about it! For obvious reasons, you need to be an admin to add things; but any member can view your data. (banned/kicked users can't!)
   * **Admin Commands** - Make it easy to promote and demote users with the admin module!
   * **Restrict** - This module allows you to do that easily, by exposing some common actions, so everyone will see!
   * **Federations** - Ah, group management. It's all fun and games, until you start getting spammers in, and you need to ban them. Then you need to start banning more, and more, and it gets painful. But then you have multiple groups, and you don't want these spammers in any of your groups - how can you deal? Do you have to ban them manually, in all your groups? No more! With federations, you can make a ban in one chat overlap to all your other chats.You can even appoint federation admins, so that your trustworthiest admins can ban across all the chats that you want to protect.
   * **Reports** - An easy way to call all admins.
   * **Approval** - Sometimes, you might trust a user not to send unwanted content.
Maybe not enough to make them admin, but you might be ok with locks, blocklists, and antiflood not applying to them.
That's what approvals are for - approve of trustworthy users to allow them to send
